- Construction of box plots
- Generation of line plots for trend analysis
- Application of histograms to delineate column distributions
  
## Key Findings
1. Stacked bar plot representations reveal the distribution of weather summaries across different years, highlighting prevalent weather classifications.
2. Observations show diverse trends in temperature, humidity, and wind speed over the temporal span.
3. Utilizing seaborn, distributions of temperature, apparent temperature, humidity, and precipitation type were depicted, revealing varying degrees of skewness or symmetry.

## Summary
The analysis of weather data spanning a decade provides insights into seasonal variations and weekly temperature trends. These findings contribute to our understanding of climate dynamics and can inform future research and forecasting efforts.
